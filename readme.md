Solved a trajectory tracking problem for a ground differential-drive robot by using Reinforcement Learning via receding-horizon Certainty Equivalent Control (CEC) and Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI). Compared and analyzed the algorithmâ€™s performance based on complexity, collision avoidance and tracking error.


# Code modifications
The CEC implementation is done by the cec_controller() function in main.py itself. 
The error function is modified to display more appropriate values.
The other functions in main.py and utils.py remain the same as before.
